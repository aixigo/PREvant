This file provides some hints and examples how to develop PREvant.

# Backend Development

You can build PREvant's backend API with [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) in the sub directory `/api`. For example, `cargo run` build and starts the backend so that it will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

When you than interact with the REST API to deploy service, it is worthwhile to have a look into the [Traefik dashboard](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/operations/dashboard/#the-dashboard) to double check if PREvant exposes the services as expected.

If you want to use PREvant's frontend during development, head over to the [Frontend Development section](#fe-dev).

Without any CLI options, PREvant will use the Docker API. If you want to develop with against Kubernetes, have a look into the [Kubernetes section](#k8s-dev).

## <a name="k8s-dev"></a>Kubernetes Backend

For developing against a local Kubernetes cluster you can use [k3d].

1. Create a cluster:

   ```bash
   k3d cluster create dash -p "80:80@loadbalancer" -p "443:443@loadbalancer"
   ```

2. Start PREvant with Kubernetes (it will infer the cluster configuration by searching for kube-config file or in-cluster environment variables)

   ```bash
   cargo run -- --runtime-type Kubernetes
   ```

3. Deploy some containers and observe the result [here](http://localhost/master/whoami/):

   ```bash
   curl -X POST -d '[{"serviceName": "whoami", "image": "quay.io/truecharts/whoami:1.8.1"}]' \
      -H "Content-type: application/json" \
      http://localhost:8000/api/apps/master
   ```

4. Check Traefik's dashboard by exposing the port (see command below and detail [here](https://stackoverflow.com/q/68565048/5088458)) and visit [`http://localhost:9000/dashboard`](http://localhost:9000/dashboard).

   ```bash
   kubectl -n kube-system port-forward $(kubectl -n kube-system get pods --selector "app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik" --output name) 9000:9000
   ```

# <a name="fe-dev"></a>Frontend Development

PREvant’s frontend is located in the `/frontend` directory and uses [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) for development and builds. You can either [build the static HTML files](#frontend-static-html-build) or [run the development server](#frontend-development-server). There is also a section on how to [run the frontend tests](#frontend-tests).

## <a name="fe-static-html"></a>Frontend Static HTML Build

To build the static HTML files that can be served by PREvant's backend:

1. Change into the `/frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```
3. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

Afterwards, start the backend (see [Backend Development](#backend-development)). PREvant will then be accessible at:
**http://localhost:8000**

## <a name="fe-dev-server"></a>Frontend Development Server

To run the frontend in development mode:

1. Start the backend as described in [Backend Development](#backend-development).

   Make also sure to pass `--base-url http://localhost:9001` when starting the
   backend because some of the features work only if the “guessed” backend URL
   matches to the frontend development server URL. For example, authentication
   works only if the redirect URI matches relative to the dev server URL.

2. Navigate to the `/frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

3. Install dependencies and start the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm ci
   npm run serve
   ```

4. Open the following URL in your browser:
   **http://localhost:9001**

## Frontend Advanced Development Scenarios

- **Async API Documentation UI**  
  You can develop and test the async API UI locally at:  
  http://localhost:9001/#/async-api-ui/%2Ffixtures%2Fasyncapi%2Fstreetlights-kafka-asyncapi.yml
- **Open API Documentation UI**  
  You can also develop and test the openAPI UI locally at:  
  http://localhost:9001/#/open-api-ui/%2Ffixtures%2Fopenapi%2Fpetstore-api-swagger.json

## Frontend Tests

We use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end testing.

Before running the tests for the first time, you must install the required browsers:

```bash
npx playwright install
```

This only needs to be done once (or whenever Playwright updates its browser requirements).

To run the Playwright tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Alternatively, you can run the tests in debug mode (with a UI):

```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

Some tests rely on fixture files (e.g., AsyncAPI YAMLs) that are only served during development:

- We use a custom Vite plugin to serve these fixtures at `/fixtures/...`.
- Fixture files are not included in the production build.
- This allows Playwright tests to fetch example data without relying on external URLs that may be unavailable in CI or offline environments.

# Integration Testing

To test the image end-2-end, build the Docker image (`docker build --pull -t
aixigo/prevant .`) and then choose testing via
[testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) or [k3d].

## Testcontainers for Docker Backend

```sh
export RUST_LOG="info,testcontainers=debug"
cargo test --manifest-path api-tests/Cargo.toml --test docker -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
```

## K3s for Kubernetes Backend

0. Build the bootstrap image:
   ```sh
   cd examples/Kubernetes
   docker build --pull -t aixigo/httpd-bootstrap-example -f Dockerfile.bootstrap  .
   cd -
   ```
1. Create cluster and import the PREvant image:
   ```sh
   k3d cluster create dash -p "8080:80@loadbalancer" --no-rollback --k3s-arg --disable=metrics-server@server:* --image rancher/k3s:v1.31.7-k3s1
   k3d image import aixigo/prevant -c dash
   k3d image import aixigo/httpd-bootstrap-example -c dash
   ```
2. Deploy PREvant:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f examples/Kubernetes/RBAC-authorization.yml
   kubectl apply -f examples/Kubernetes/PREvant.yml
   ```
3. Run Tests:
   ```sh
   cargo test --manifest-path api-tests/Cargo.toml --test k3s
   ```
